= Analysis
This section provides the analytical documentation for an application designed 
to extend existing filesystems with #link(label("voc_relationship"))[relationships] 
and #link(label("voc_tag"))[tags]. The section defines functional and qualitative 
requirements, including work with semantic and hierarchical connections, the interaction 
with the system, and its qualities. It explains how the system handles user accounts
and their file permissions. In the last subsection, I show possible interactions via use cases,
including creating and deleting semantic information, browsing through the filesystem, and using
the DSL.
